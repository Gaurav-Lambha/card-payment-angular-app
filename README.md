# card-payment-app
Create a card management program in angular as shown in the image below:
equirements:
 As a user, I should be able to add a new credit/debit card, delete it and update only 
Name and expiry of the card.
 If card is expired, date should be highlighted in red to indicate that expiry needs to 
be updated.
 Upon adding/updating the information, proper validations should be applied to the 
expiry date and card fields.
 Upon submitting the form, an updated list should appear showing the newly added/ 
updated card.
 When there aren't any cards in the list, I should see the text "No cards have been 
saved yet."
 Create apis to save/edit/delete the cards in MongoDB. Since this is a just a generic 
card app, display all the cards that are available in the collection. No need to link a 
user to a specific card.
 Use basic styling techniques ( no need to copy all style designs ), just keep the styling 
minimal.
